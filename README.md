# 👋 Hi, I’m Mickey (@mknoir)

I’m a computational biologist and builder focused on **AI-driven molecular biology** designing tools that make advanced experimentation accessible to anyone with an idea.

## 🧩 Current Focus
- **Agentic Architectures & GNNs**: Exploring multi-agent systems and graph neural networks for **immunology** and **cardiometabolic disorders**, with an emphasis on understanding complex cell–cell interactions.  
- **Omics Workflows**: Building automated pipelines for genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, using agents to orchestrate data ingestion, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Deep Learning for Imaging**: Applying PyTorch-based models to cellular and tissue imaging datasets.

## 🧪 Projects
- **CornucopiaBio** – *AI-native Contract Research Organization*: Automating wet-lab workflows (qPCR, ELISA, multi-omics) with robotics and natural-language interfaces.  
- Multimodal language-model platform for scientists, enabling retrieval-augmented generation across text, tabular data, and gene-expression images.  
- **Agentic Lab Automation** – Experimental framework for self-correcting Opentrons/Hamilton protocols using LLM agents and feedback loops.

## 🤝 Collaboration
I’m always interested in teaming up on:
- Graph-based modeling of immune networks.
- Automated multi-omics analysis pipelines.
- Applied deep learning for biological imaging.
